In this lab, we'll utilize inheritance functionality and define various Beverage objects and its properties. You'll have the opportunity to practice:

* Defining a base class and creating an inheritance hierarchy
* Defining derived classes and inheriting data and reusing functionality from a base class
* Overriding inherited methods from the parent class in the derived classes
* Installing pytest and unit testing your code

**Note: In general, it is always important to work on labs and reading early so you can gain the proper context and utilize our office hours to seek assistance / ask clarifying questions during the weekdays before the deadline if needed!**

It may be a good idea to read up on some concepts we'll be using in this lab before you get started, specifically Chapter 1.4.6.2 (Inheritance).
