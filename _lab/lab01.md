In this lab, you'll have the opportunity to practice:

* Defining classes in Python
* Defining methods in Python classes

**Note:** In general, it is always important to work on labs and reading early so you can gain the proper context and utilize our office hours to seek assistance / ask clarifying questions during the week before the deadline if needed!

It is a good idea to read up on some tools we'll use in this lab before you get started, specifically Chapter 1.4.2.1 (String Formatting) and 1.4.6 - 1.4.6.1 (Object Oriented Programming).
